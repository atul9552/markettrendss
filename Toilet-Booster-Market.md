As people become more aware of water conservation techniques and the benefits of booster systems, demand is expected to rise significantly. In fact, the global market is projected to expand by over 5% annually during the 2023-2033 period.</p>    <ul>        <li><strong>Consumer Behavior Shift:</strong> Thereâ€™s a noticeable shift from basic utility to more integrated, convenience-driven bathroom solutions. Customers now expect high performance, eco-friendliness, and ease of installation.</li>        <li><strong>Regulatory Support:</strong> Government regulations supporting water conservation will likely remain a major driver, with more regions mandating stricter water usage rules.</li>    </ul>    <p>In conclusion, the toilet booster market is at an inflection point.
